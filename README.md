# Tweet-Scraper
This is a personal project I am working on to improve my Python skills and prepare for eventually applying NLP techniques 
to Twitter information. 
I am attempting to pull tweets, clean them, remove stop words and return a dataframe suitable for sentiment analysis. 

### Set-up
The file "dev_logins.py" must be filled with user's personal Twitter Dev keys and tokens. 

### Package development versions used
- Python 3.6.8
- tweepy 3.6.0
- pandas 0.24.1
- numpy 1.15.4
- textblob 0.15.3
- many-stop-words 0.2.2
